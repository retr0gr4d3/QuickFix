# QuickFix (WIP)
QuickFix (working title) is an easy troubleshooter for Windows-based bugs and glitches.

## The project files will be hosted in [the current working branch](https://github.com/retr0gr4d3/QuickFix/tree/staging-beta) until v1 is ready.

This project uses C# and the .NET Framework to create an application which (hopefully) helps the user to solve common Windows problems, from sound to solving the [missing Windows Security application which occurrs due to Windows Insider](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-security-missing/827b934c-c95e-4ea1-880b-529729747c96).

The end goal is to have an application that contains the following:
- One-click button for audio problem solving. [See issue #1](https://github.com/retr0gr4d3/QuickFix/issues/1).
- One-click button for the aforementioned issue.
- One-click no-reboot button for network reset.
- One-click advised-reboot button for network reset.
- One-click task-restart button for Explorer.exe.
- One-click temp folder clean button for extra space.
- One-click reinstall button for Windows Security.
- One-click button for multiple registry tweaks.
