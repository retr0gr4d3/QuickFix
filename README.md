# This stage of development is over. The project is being re-written in a better format now that I know I can do things differently. You can find the current active branch by visiting the [main branch](https://github.com/retr0gr4d3/QuickFix/) of this project.

## QuickFix
QuickFix (working title) is an easy troubleshooter for Windows-based bugs and glitches.

## The files contained here do not represent the final product. Proceed with caution, always check the source. I cannot confirm whether any forks of this project are safe.

Please note that this is Staging, my entire working directory is just dumped to this branch. You can find the solution to the project [here](https://github.com/retr0gr4d3/QuickFix/blob/staging/Project_QuickFix.sln), I will also be uploading the built application made before upload. 

This project uses the CMD utility to "shortcut" the process of manual problem solving in Windows. It is intended to help users who do not know how to fix certain issues in Windows from audio bugs to networking issues and freeing storage space by properly emptying temp folders and directories.

This tool will evolve and take better shape as I continue the journey into C# and .NET.
