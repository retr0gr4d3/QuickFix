# This stage of development is over. The project is being re-written in a better format now that I know I can do things differently. You can find the current active branch by visiting the [main branch](https://github.com/retr0gr4d3/QuickFix/) of this project. It is only being retained for educational purposes.

[Issue #1](https://github.com/retr0gr4d3/QuickFix/issues/1) is not solved in any of the solutions here. That is going to be resolved in a future build.
